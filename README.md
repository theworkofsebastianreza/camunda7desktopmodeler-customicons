# Camunda Desktop Modeler Plugin to render individual Icons in Camunda 7 Diagrams
This Plugin enables the Camunda Modeler to render individual icons for your task Template, (maybe) just like in Camunda 8.
It builds on the work of Philipp Fromme with the Plugin templateas found here https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler-plugins/tree/main/bpmn-js-plugin-example

## Create Element Template for Activitiy
<ol>
  <li>Use your own or edit the included Task template lightning_tasktemplate.json and adjust it to your needs. At the moment, this is an external task that publishes to a certain topic.</li>
  <li>The Icon can be adapted with the Icon property as in the documentation of Camunda 8 https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/element-templates/defining-templates/</li>
  <li>Save that file  in the folder resources\element-templates of your Camunda Desktop Modeler.</li>
</ol>

## Install Plugin for the Desktop Modeler
<ol>
  <li>Place the folder C7CustomIcon into the folder of your Desktop Modeler: \resources\plugins e.g. resources\plugins\C7CustomIcon</li>
  <li>Restart the Desktop Modeler</li>
</ol>

## Change the plugin
<ol>
  <li>If you want to make changes to the Plugin and want to see them, you have to run 'npm install' first in the C7CustomIcon folder, that lies within resources\plugins</li>
  <li>The main file to work in, is /client/C7CustomIcon.js</li>
  <li>After you have made your changes, run 'npm run bundle' in the above mentiones Plugin folder.</li>
  <li>Don´t forget to write here about your cool new features/ideas! The other Camunda 7 Fans surely will be grateful :-)</li>
</ol>

## Start using your own Icons for Plugins in Camunda 7!
Start up your Desktop Modeler. Start a new Camunda 7 Diagram and add an Activity. Apply the template. You should now see the individual icon.
At the moment this just works for plain activities (so don´t select User / Service / ScritTask as type)
